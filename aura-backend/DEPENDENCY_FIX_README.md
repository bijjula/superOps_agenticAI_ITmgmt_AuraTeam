# Dependency Installation Fix

## Problem
The service desk host was failing to start with the error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'
```

## Root Cause
1. The root `aura-backend/requirements.txt` was missing several critical dependencies that were only present in `service-desk-host/requirements.txt`
2. The startup script was silently hiding installation errors by redirecting output to `/dev/null`
3. Dependencies were only being installed from the service-specific requirements file, not the root requirements

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Root Requirements (`aura-backend/requirements.txt`)
Added missing dependencies:
- `sqlalchemy[asyncio]==2.0.23` - The missing SQLAlchemy ORM
- `asyncpg==0.29.0` - PostgreSQL async driver
- `redis[hiredis]==5.0.1` - Redis client with hiredis for better performance
- `python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0` - JWT authentication
- `passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4` - Password hashing
- Additional testing dependencies

### 2. Improved Startup Script (`start_service_desk_with_env.sh`)
- Now installs from both root and service-specific requirements files
- Shows installation output instead of hiding it
- Includes proper error checking for each installation step
- Added dependency testing before starting the service

### 3. Created Dependency Test Script (`test_dependencies.py`)
- Comprehensive test of all required Python modules
- Clear success/failure reporting
- Actionable error messages with fix instructions

## Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Run the Fixed Startup Script
```bash
cd aura-backend
./start_service_desk_with_env.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing Steps
```bash
cd aura-backend

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r service-desk-host/requirements.txt

# Test dependencies
python test_dependencies.py

# If all tests pass, start the service
cd service-desk-host
python main.py
```

### Option 3: Test Dependencies Only
```bash
cd aura-backend
source venv/bin/activate
python test_dependencies.py
```

## Expected Output
When running the dependency test, you should see:

## Files Modified
1. `aura-backend/requirements.txt` - Added missing dependencies
2. `aura-backend/start_service_desk_with_env.sh` - Improved installation and error handling
3. `aura-backend/test_dependencies.py` - New dependency test script (created)

## Verification
After applying this fix, the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'` error should be resolved, and the service should start successfully.
